      <h2>Welcome to Computer Hardware Basics</h2>
      <p>This website provides comprehensive information about computer hardware. Whether you're a beginner or an enthusiast, you'll find everything you need to know about the components that make up a computer.</p>
      <p>Explore our sidebar to learn more about specific hardware components!</p>

      <div id="cpu" class="component-info">
        <h3>CPU (Central Processing Unit)</h3>
        <p>The CPU is the brain of the computer. It performs calculations and executes instructions to carry out tasks. CPUs come in various models and speeds, affecting the overall performance of a computer.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Clock Speed:</strong> Determines how many operations the CPU can perform per second.</li>
          <li><strong>Cores:</strong> Multiple cores allow for better multitasking and parallel processing.</li>
          <li><strong>Cache:</strong> Small amount of very fast memory on the CPU to store frequently used data.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div id="ram" class="component-info">
        <h3>RAM (Random Access Memory)</h3>
        <p>RAM is the temporary storage that the CPU uses to store data that is actively being worked on. More RAM allows a computer to handle more tasks simultaneously and improves performance.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Types:</strong> DDR3, DDR4, DDR5 - each newer type offers better performance and efficiency.</li>
          <li><strong>Capacity:</strong> Typically ranges from 4GB to 64GB or more in modern systems.</li>
          <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Measured in MHz, faster RAM improves data processing speed.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div id="hdd-ssd" class="component-info">
        <h3>HDD / SSD (Hard Disk Drive / Solid State Drive)</h3>
        <p>HDDs and SSDs are the primary storage devices for a computer. HDDs are mechanical drives with larger storage capacities at lower costs, while SSDs are faster and more reliable, though typically more expensive.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>HDD:</strong> Uses spinning disks to read/write data, larger storage for a lower price.</li>
          <li><strong>SSD:</strong> Uses flash memory, much faster read/write speeds, more durable.</li>
          <li><strong>NVMe:</strong> A type of SSD with even faster data transfer rates, connected via PCIe.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div id="motherboard" class="component-info">
        <h3>Motherboard</h3>
        <p>The motherboard is the main circuit board that connects all components of the computer. It houses the CPU, RAM, and other essential parts, allowing them to communicate with each other.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Form Factor:</strong> ATX, Micro-ATX, Mini-ITX - sizes that determine the layout and compatibility.</li>
          <li><strong>Chipset:</strong> Determines the features and capabilities of the motherboard.</li>
          <li><strong>Ports and Slots:</strong> Includes USB, PCIe slots, SATA ports, etc., for connecting components.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div id="gpu" class="component-info">
        <h3>GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)</h3>
        <p>The GPU is responsible for rendering images and videos. It is crucial for gaming, video editing, and other graphics-intensive tasks. Dedicated GPUs have their own memory and processing power.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Integrated GPU:</strong> Built into the CPU, suitable for basic tasks and light gaming.</li>
          <li><strong>Dedicated GPU:</strong> Separate from the CPU, with its own memory (VRAM) for better performance.</li>
          <li><strong>VRAM:</strong> The GPU's memory, important for handling textures and graphical data.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div id="psu" class="component-info">
        <h3>PSU (Power Supply Unit)</h3>
        <p>The PSU converts electrical power from an outlet into usable power for the computer's components. It supplies power to the motherboard, drives, and other hardware components.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Wattage:</strong> Determines how much power the PSU can supply, important for high-end components.</li>
          <li><strong>Efficiency Rating:</strong> 80 Plus certification indicates efficiency, reducing waste heat and electricity usage.</li>
          <li><strong>Modular PSUs:</strong> Allow users to connect only the cables they need, reducing clutter.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div id="cooling-systems" class="component-info">
        <h3>Cooling Systems</h3>
        <p>Cooling systems, including fans and liquid cooling setups, are essential for maintaining optimal temperatures of the CPU, GPU, and other components to prevent overheating and ensure efficient performance.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Air Cooling:</strong> Uses fans and heatsinks to dissipate heat, common and cost-effective.</li>
          <li><strong>Liquid Cooling:</strong> Uses liquid to transfer heat away from components, more efficient but expensive.</li>
          <li><strong>Thermal Paste:</strong> Applied between the CPU/GPU and heatsink to improve heat transfer.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div id="input-output-devices" class="component-info">
        <h3>Input/Output Devices</h3>
        <p>Input devices like keyboards and mice allow users to interact with the computer, while output devices like monitors and printers display or produce the results of the computer's processes.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Input Devices:</strong> Keyboards, mice, scanners, etc., used to input data into the computer.</li>
          <li><strong>Output Devices:</strong> Monitors, printers, speakers, etc., used to receive data from the computer.</li>
          <li><strong>Peripheral Connections:</strong> USB, Bluetooth, and other connections for input/output devices.</li>
        </ul>
